The Akamai Web Performance Foundations course for Akamai University is designed to
familiarize you with the Akamai Web Performance portfolio and its key capabilities. It offers an
introduction into the features of the Akamai Intelligent Platform that enable those capabilities
through a combination of learning interventions such as conceptual discussions, hands-on lab
exercises, facilitator-led demonstrations, and group-based activities.
